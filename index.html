It was mid-afteroon, and Gabriel had finished his experiment. Though he was a biology teacher, and taught his students about the necessity of healthy diet, his own diet schedule was not on time. He had skipped lunch, and had proceeded to boil leaves in ethanol and drop iodine solutions over them. After all, what could've been more important than conducting experiments and preparing slides for the observation of his own students? Clinking and clanking noises echoed throughout the Biology Lab, as his students entered the Lab. 

<br><br><b>"Good afternoon!"</b> He smiled as his class seated themselves, glass tumblers filled with water, and a singular leaf, which was immersed in it. <b>"I would request all of you to NOT touch the glass tumblers, especially the leaves, the droppers or anything else kept in front of you, until my further notice."</b> Gabriel eyed his students, who appeared to be intrigued and excited. <b>"Today we will be covering an exciting topic, which is very crucial for the existence of a plant. It is called Photosynthesis, basically the process through which a plant prepares it's own food, with the help of nutrients in it's surroundings."</b> Gabriel turned towards the board, which contained a diagram he had drawn.<b>I want all of you to open your books and write a short essay on Photosynthesis, and after that, we will be proceeding with an experiment to prove that photosynthesis occurs, and leads to the production of starch, also known as glucose, and oxygen which we breath." </b><br><br>

 After half the time had passed by, and his students had submitted the essays, he decided that it would now be the perfect time to conduct the experiment. <b>"The jars in front of you consist of a leaf boiled in ethanol, and immersed in clean water. You can use your forceps to pick the leaf and put it into your trays."</b> Gabriel couldn't help but smile at his students's reactions towards a decolorized leaf. <b>"Now, you will be using your droppers and putting two drops of iodine onto the leaves, and your leaves would look something like this."</b> He turned to face the class, holding his own tray, which consisted of blue-black leaves <br><br>
<b>"The blue-black colour symbolises presence of starch, and starch is the end product of photosynthesis. It is the food which is produced by the plants using this process, and you are aware that leaves are the kitchen of the plants."</b> He grinned, explaining the terms using simple language.<b> "Now, you all can proceed with your own experiments, and show them to me once you are done."</b> Gabriel sat on his seat, keeping his eye on the students who were now working and chatting, conducting their experiments.<br>
